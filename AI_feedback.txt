Q: I am sending you a copy of my portfolio. Asses my current investment strategy based on global stock market on the given date.
A: Based on the portfolio data given, as of March 6th 2014, you mainly own stocks spanning a few different sectors, specifically consumer discretionary represented by GameStop Corp. (GME), technology represented by BlackBerry Ltd (BB), and fixed income represented by iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB).

Your investment is quite diversified, with most of it in fixed income, which is generally considered to be more stable and lower risk than equities. However, the overall value of your portfolio is low, perhaps as a result of market downturn, poor stock performance, or initial low investment.

On the date specified, invested in GameStop Corp. (GME) just before it made significant gains, which shows a keen sense for potential turnarounds and an appetite for risk. This decision could have paid off significantly as GME stock was valued at around $4 in Jan 2014 and jumped to over $350 by Jan 2021.

Nearly 10% of your portfolio is invested in BlackBerry Ltd (BB), which has been struggling in the market due to heavy competition and failures to innovate. Although BB&#x27;s price has been volatile over the years, it hasn&#x27;t seen significant growth and could be considered a risky investment.

Your largest investment is in iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB), which is a low-risk, steady-return ETF. It adds stability to your portfolio but also limits the possibility of high returns.

Your portfolio seems to show a mix of both risk-taking and conservative strategies. However, the total value and potential return of your portfolio may be limited by the relatively low price of these stocks. 

Remember, investment should align with your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Ensure to regularly rebalance the portfolio and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor.
